I am a Research Assistant in the **Department of Brain Sciences** at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/brain-sciences/), working on a **Wellcome Trust-funded project** focused on optimizing retention rates in mental health clinical trials.

My work bridges **deep learning**, **clinical data analysis**, and real-world implementation of AI in healthcare settings. I am particularly interested in how artificial intelligence can uncover actionable insights from large-scale longitudinal clinical datasets and improve the design and outcome of mental health research.
